There is considerable interest in leveraging SAFIRE and eduGAIN to integrate with the various library information providers, such as academic content, journal, and database publishers. Information providers variously term this "Shibboleth", "SAML" or "Institutional" logins, and in most cases are already integrated with other federations around the world.

The following documents the integration status of various providers in SAFIRE.

# Values needed by information providers

Publishers and information providers may ask for an entity ID or IdP identity. If they're accessing your identity provider via eduGAIN, the value they will need is your institution's [proxied entity ID](https://phph.safire.ac.za/mdfileview?type=published&fed=SAFIRE-BIRK-PUBLIC). You can get this by clicking on your institution in [our list](https://phph.safire.ac.za/mdfileview?type=published&fed=SAFIRE-BIRK-PUBLIC), and then copying the entity ID field. (Note that the version displayed in the list is sometimes truncated.)

You may also be asked for a WAYFless URL. Different providers have different mechanisms for constructing these, so you will need to refer to the providers's documentation. However, they will always involve a [URL encoded](https://www.urlencoder.org/) version of the entity ID described in the preceding paragraph.

If you are asked for an entitlement value, you will most likely use `urn:mace:dir:entitlement:common-lib-terms` as described in the [common-lib-terms specification](https://www.internet2.edu/products-services/trust-identity-middleware/mace-registries/urnmace-namespace/urn-mace-dir-registry/urn-mace-dir-entitlement/) and [_eduPersonEntitlement_]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersonentitlement.md" >}}).

Finally, you may be asked for affiliation or scoped affiliation values. These are the values your institution sets for [_eduPersonScopedAffiliation_]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersonscopedaffiliation.md" >}})Â and will be a value like member@example.ac.za. You may be able to figure out the correct ones by logging into our [test service provider](https://testsp.safire.ac.za/), but generally you should confirm them with your own identity provider administrator or IT support staff.

# Hints from other federations

Other federations have links to providers' documentation that may prove useful to those trying to get this to work:
