The exact deployment profile(s) that SAFIRE will use has not yet been fully determined. However it's a fair assumption that the WebSSO profile will be, or will be based upon, the [SAML2int profile](http://saml2int.org/).

Most of the technology profile has been written based on this assumption, and the initial deployment should comply with this.
