The [Security Incident Response Trust Framework for Federated Identity](https://refeds.org/sirtfi) (Sirtfi) aims to enable the coordination of incident response across federated organisations. A growing number of service providers require identity providers to be Sirtfi compliant before they will grant users access to their service.

### Attesting Sirtfi compliance

If you need to attest to your institution's Sirtfi compliance, in addition to a [registration request]({{< ref "/technical/saml2/forms.md" >}}) you also need to supply a statement of your Sirtfi compliance. You can use the following template:

  * [SAFIRE Sirtfi Compliance Template](./SAFIRE-Sirtfi-Compliance-Template.docx)

This statement must be on institional letterhead, and should be signed by the person responsible for conducting the assessment (which may or may not be your technical contact).
