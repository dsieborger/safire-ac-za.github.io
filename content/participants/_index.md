Participants are those organizations and institutions who join the South African Identity Federation on behalf of their user communities. They either act as identity providers (they are the home organisation of a group of users), as service providers (they provide a web based service they want users to access), or both.

Not all organisations are eligible to become participants in SAFIRE. Detailed information on how to participate is given in the sections below.
