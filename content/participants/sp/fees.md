SAFIRE does not charge service providers a participation fee, and there are no recurring costs for participating in SAFIRE as a service provider.

It is possible that in future we may introduce a once-off joining fee to cover some of the administrative overheads. However, if this were introduced, it would not be applied retrospectively. (Existing service providers at the time of its introduction would be exempt.)

Where service providers ask SAFIRE to assist with integration, and where SAFIRE [is able to provide such assistance,]({{< ref "/participants/support.md" >}}) we reserve the right to recover an additional costs we incur at our prevailing consulting rates. This would be negotiated in advance on a per-case basis.
