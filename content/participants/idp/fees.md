SAFIRE's fee schedule has not yet been finalised. However, the general principal is that identity providers shouldÂ contribute towards the costs of running the federation.

Once these costs have been determined, they will be published on this website and announced to existing participants. Per the [Participation Agreement](/safire/policy/participation/), participants will then have some time to decide whether to become a member of SAFIRE or to withdraw from the federation.
