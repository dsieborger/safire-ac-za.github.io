To aid providers in preparing new metadata for the transition, we've developed a simple online SAML metadata validation tool. This tool applies very similar rules to SAFIRE's metadata aggregator. The tool is not intended to be normative (we may accept metadata that the validator finds problematic or vice versa). Instead it is intended to allow providers to get early feedback on potential problems with their metadata.

You can access the metadata validator at [https://validator.safire.ac.za/](https://validator.safire.ac.za/).

Please note that it is still under development.
