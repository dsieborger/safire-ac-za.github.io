The late 2015, the SAFIRE steering committee approved a proposal to collaborate with the Danish federation, [WAYF](http://www.wayf.dk/). The intent was to gain insight and experience from the Danes, in the hopes of spring-boarding our own federation into production.

As part of this collaboration, the newly appointed Project Director will spend a week at WAYF's offices in Denmark before travelling to REFEDS 32 and TNC16. During this visit, he will be exposed to all aspects of WAYF's operations --- technical, policy, and governance.
