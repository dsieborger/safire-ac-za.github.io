Services are the core of a Federation and for any federation to become truly useful, it must have a good portfolio of services available to its members.

As such the community was invited to suggest services that they would find useful. The following is the list of services were suggested during the FID workshop:
<!-- more -->

  * RIMS

  * Video conferencing (Vidyo)

  * Library services

  * Google Scholar

  * CHPC related stuff

  * Moodle

  * Sakai

  * ITS

  * Research centres of excellence

  * SAGRID

  * Big Data Centre

  * Web stores

  * Adobe online services

  * Ticketing systems

  * GitHub

  * Student Discounts

  * eduGAIN

  * Google Apps

  * SA-cubed (virtual observatory)

Each of these services need to be evaluated and prioritised according to some open process. This will be communicated as soon as possible.
