In our ongoing work to [integrate library journal and platform providers]({{< ref "/technical/resources/integrating-library-resource-providers-via-safire.md" >}}), it has become apparent that we need to support the [eduPersonEntitlement]({{< ref "/technical/attributes/edupersonentitlement.md" >}}) attribute. Support for this attribute has therefore been added to the Federation hub, as well as the test identity and service providers.
