The [SAFIRE transition plan]({{< ref "/safire/news/safire-transition-plan.md" >}}) has been updated to set an explicit end-of-life for the deprecated full-mesh federation. All existing identity providers within the full-mesh metadata will expire shortly after midnight on 1 July 2017.

Service provider entities will remain for a bit longer, and decision to expire them will be based on the volume of logins we see through the transitional hub provider. However, the target date for this is 31 July 2017.
