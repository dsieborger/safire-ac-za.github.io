[Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University](http://www.nmmu.ac.za/) and the [University of Cape Town](https://www.uct.ac.za/)Â have both recently signed the Participation Agreement and join SAFIRE as full participants.

UCT has further completed technical integration as an identity provider and thus becomes the first South African university to be able to benefit from [SAFIRE's membership of eduGAIN]({{< ref "/safire/news/safire-joins-edugain-20170220.md" >}}).
