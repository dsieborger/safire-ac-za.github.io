The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has signed the Participation Agreement and joined SAFIRE as a full participant. The [SANReN CompetencyÂ Area](http://www.sanren.ac.za/) at the CSIR incubated the SAFIRE project for several years, and we are delighted to formally welcome them into the Federation that they were so integral in establishing.
