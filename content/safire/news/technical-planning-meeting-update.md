On the 21st July 2015, the SAFIRE lead institutions came together to determine the future technical implementation for SAFIRE.

The following are the key highlights of the meeting:
<!-- more -->

  * The architecture of SAFIRE will need to change from its current mesh topology to a hub-and-spoke topology. The goal is to implement this hub-and-spoke topology by the end of September 2015.

  * TENET will provide the infrastructure to host the new implementation

  * Institutions wanting to join SAFIRE in a mesh architecture will be given an option to do so and the technical team will need to figure out a means to make this possible.

  * A dedicated technical resource is required to work on SAFIRE. This individual will be funded by the lead institutions. The steering committee chairperson will have a discussion with TENET to begin the process of hiring such a resource.

  * A follow on workshop to discuss the governance requirements for SAFIRE will need to take place.

  * A Steering Committee Meeting will need to be organised to communicate the outcomes of this meeting.

More updates to follow in the upcoming days and weeks.
